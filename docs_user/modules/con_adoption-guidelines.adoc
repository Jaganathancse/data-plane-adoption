* Review your custom configuration every major release.
* Prepare a Method of Procedure (MOP) that is specific to your environment. All commands in the adoption documentation are examples and should not be copied and pasted verbatim.

** You can use the representative staging environment to prepare a MOP and validate any changes in content.
** Ensure that the RHEL upgrade is validated in the representative staging environment.
* Use Satellite for localized and version-pinned rpm content where your Compute nodes are located. In the production environment, use the content that was tested in the staging environment.
